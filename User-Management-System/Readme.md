Frameworks and Languages Used:
-
1) Java: The backend is built using the Java programming language. Java is a popular choice for web development because of its stability and scalability.


2) Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a popular Java framework for building web applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use platform that allows developers to quickly build production-ready applications.

Data Flow
-
1. User Interface (UI): This is the front-end component of the system, which allows the user to interact with the system.
2. Controller: This component receives requests from the UI, handles them, and sends responses back to the UI.
3. Services: This component handles the business logic of the system, including user validation, user creation, user deletion, and user updates.
4. This component provides a way to interact with the Database.
5. This is the persistent storage component of the system, which stores the user data.

Project Summary:
-
The User Management System follows a standard layered architecture, with the Controller, Services, and Repository components providing different levels of abstraction for the system. This architecture ensures that the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable, while the data flow diagram shows how the different components interact with each other to provide a seamless user experience.
